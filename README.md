# env

My environment. Dotfiles, defaults, and the like.

This environment assumes you are using OSX, ZSH and Homebrew.

## Using

Install it. It won't overwrite existing dotfiles.

    git clone https://github.com/rcarver/env
    cd env
    ./setup

Set your shell to `zsh` and you're good to go.

## Inspiration

Much of this is a stripped down version of Zach Holman's [dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles),
which I forked and used directly for many years. I wanted to simplify and reset,
but not lose the things I actually use. That became this project.
